[Kirkman](../Characters/NPCs/Kirkman.md#) filled a hotel in [Boston](../Places/Boston/index.md#) where his birthday party was being held with humans to be hunted for entertainment during [Session 1](../Sessions/Session%201.md#). No humans were supposed to be left alive by the end of the night however [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) managed to rescue a number of them. [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) assisted [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) in rescuing one escapee but did not stay the rest of the night.

[Sasha](../Characters/PCs/Sasha.md#), [Amelia](../Characters/PCs/Amelia.md#), [Zeff√©r](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) and [Trisha](../Characters/NPCs/Trisha.md#) were aware of what was happening but decided to leave the party to get cake instead.

In [Session 4](../Sessions/Session%204.md#), [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) learnt that more humans escaped than just the one's [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) saved. These witnesses begin going missing and many of the factions want to find them for their own purposes. [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) is tasks with tracking down two of these witnesses.
