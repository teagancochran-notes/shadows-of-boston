Saul was captured and brought before the [[../Organisations/Regatta|Regatta]] council to determine if he could be used or killed.

Saul was questioned by members of the council and it was voted that he would be allowed to live and serve the [[../Organisations/Regatta|Regatta]] as their "hunting dog", tasked with killing Kindred on behalf of the organisation.
