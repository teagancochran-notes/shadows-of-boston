# Notes
## Gameplay
- If you say it's been x amount of days does that just mean we automatically just refill whatever we had?
	- For the most part. Some will not refill, for example, if you take aggravated willpower damage that takes a while to refill or you need to spend time with a touchstone to refill.
- If it's just all superficial?
	- For the most part. If your entire track has been superficial you can only heal so much at a time yeah but yeah if you guys do take damage I let you know if you've had the time to heal up
## Housekeeping
1:55
### [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) Council Members
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) - [Shoebill](Shoebill.md#)/Stalk?
- [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#) - [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#)
- [Owl](../Characters/NPCs/Owl.md#) - [Bluejay](../Characters/NPCs/Trisha.md#) ([Malkavian](../../Malkavian.md#))
- [Goose](Goose.md#) - [Duck](../Characters/NPCs/Damien.md#) ([Brujah](Brujah.md#))
- [Hawk](../Characters/NPCs/Hawk.md#) - [Eagle](Eagle.md#) ([Banu Haqim](Banu%20Haqim.md#))
	- middle eastern origin
	- most bloodthirsty
	- vigilante justice sort of people that hold guilts for the longest time and hunt down people who have done wrong
	- stronger when it comes some morals are a lot more based for getting Justice and revenge than any other Clan
### Gathering information on [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#)
[Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) and [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) found out 50% of the information 

- The company [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) came to power in the late 80s and since then has works as a parent company to many large production firms until the mid 2000s where a transition to sustainable and humanitarian projects began
	- In the 80s the focus of the company was industrialisation and mass production for profit before a overnight switch in the mid 2000s
	- [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) has only known them for the humanitarian focus and never knew they were 

- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) has been the only head of [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) since its creation though the council itself has gone through a couple members in its life
	- Already known by [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#)
## Story
> The nights get colder as the year begins to progress. Slowly but surely Autumn's passing through. Before long Winter, will arrive. Though the cold does bring much sadness and struggle with it, it opens up the night for all Kindred.  It's the time to truly cut loose but that hasn't quite arrived yet. As the day people walk around focusing on business and work, a couple of the outer skirt suburbs are getting ready for Halloween. Beginning to put up decorations pumpkins.  Beginning to hit the supermarkets good for carving. There's still a large majority of fun-sized candy on a lot of the shelves slowly disappearing but our story doesn't start in the day it start at night and this night comes with a story of its own.
> 
> Boston carries many stories on many figures we talked first of the Baba Yaga - a witch in the shadows ready to do deals but will the cost be worth it - but there's another story I want to focus on tonight. A lot more common to most folks; read more in fairy tale than back room sort of dealings or an old forgotten overseas nursery rhyme. The one I talk about is very common heard in many literature. It's very simple. It's a story of a big bad wolf. But the difference with that wolf is that wolf tells its own story doesn't give a about what any of your nightbringers think. The wolf cares for itself; the wolf cares for its pack; that's it. Heard some fun stories about three little pigs? Blew some houses down? No I caved them in, ate them dirty ass pigs for breakfast! Story of Little Red? No, she didn't survive. The grandmother was dead before she hit the floor. Huntsman paid off because he's a little bitch! My bitch!
> 
> And all Boston's going to be my bitch soon. You don't fuck with a wolf and expect to get out alive. You don't mess with a wolf's pack and expecting to get anything. So watch out you bleeders, blood suckers; the night may be yours but I'm going to take it fang by claw and I hope you're ready and who knows I might let you out alive can't wait to see your punk ass bitches soon

	- [Eagle](Eagle.md#) has already proceeded into the council room
	- [Trish](../Characters/NPCs/Trisha.md#) and [Damien](../Characters/NPCs/Damien.md#) are taking a long while to get ready and are talking about random nonsense off in the corner of the room and wondering what is going to go on in this council meeting

- [Dan](../Characters/NPCs/Damien.md#) asks [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) what is going on which [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) responds saying it will be an interesting meeting
	- [Dan](../Characters/NPCs/Damien.md#) came to the locker room the day before but no one else did
	- Heard there was a prison break or something was going on but doesn't get much information from [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#)

- The childers done their respective masks and head into the [Regatta HQ Council Room](Regatta%20HQ%20Council%20Room.md#) through the elevator and take positions in front of their sire's podium
- Sires arrive
- There is a brief deafening quiet as there is not a heartbeat or a single breath - just a room of corpses 
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) addresses the council, welcoming them and explains the council have a predicament due to the acquisition of an ["asset"](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#)
	- Describes [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) as loose, wild and dangerous
	- She finds him too reckless but some of the most reckless and dangerous weapons in history have been the most worth it 
		- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) has seen the impact of what dangerous weaponry can do upon a country would like to see if thus weaponry can be used against the city if the [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) can do something good with it rather than just more mindless deaths
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) explains that the meeting is to meet with [the Hunter](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) and to decide his fate via a vote

- The same setup is repeated four other times at different points in the room
- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) is brought by the guards to the center 
	- He can feel eyes behind masks judging and examining him
	- He can feel the inkling in your blood of different kindred abilities being used on him
		- He tenses up in anger
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) waves off the two guards after a bit of silence 
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) greets [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) and asks for his name
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) tells her and asks for her name however she says he can know her as [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#)
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) says his way of arriving in [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) custody was unfortunate
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) retorts it is an interesting choice of words as his would be "shot in the back and captured"
	- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) tells him the [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) don't know who shot in the back which [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) doesn't believe but he didn't see
	- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) says the reports from operatives in the field did indication to who shot [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) but says that if left there she doubts they would be able to have this conversation and that he might have been dust 
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) counters "unless I seem more useful to you" but [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) says she meant that was more meaning if left there you would have died 
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) still doesn't believe that the [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) weren't the ones to shoot him
	- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) explains that the [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) didn't know about [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#)'s arrival to fight [Desirae](../Characters/NPCs/Desirae.md#) and argues they could not plan to hunt something they didn't know about
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) explains that the purpose of the meeting is to see if [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) is to be trusted or not
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) says it goes both ways and he believes the [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) want him to work for them
	- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) tells him she does not care either way but that her decision will be based on what is said now and that it isn't looking positive
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) attempts to look nonchalant but his anger is obvious
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) explains that each council member has a question for [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) to answer question then they will make a decision at the end which [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) nods to
- [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#)
	- Appearance
		- Elegant suit, well pressed
		- Expensive very deep colours 
		- deep red undershirt
	- [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#) says that he has heard that [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) has a drive to kill Kindred
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) retorts it is increasing by the minute
	- [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#) asks "If given the opportunity to kill Kindred that go against our work - which in turn is helping better humanity - what would you say of killing Kindred that are actively destroying human lives?
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds that he could stop at the first two words as the answer is yes 
	- [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#) gets mad and insists on getting an answer to his full question, specifically Kindred harming humans, not just Kindred in general
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) says that Kindred harming humans get a special place
	- [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#) passes to the next council member
- [Hawk](../Characters/NPCs/Hawk.md#) @ 25:18

		- Wearing very flowy clothes
		- Very heavily tan skin
		- Mask is smaller than most the other masks
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) know that this is the one that's been using the most amount of powers on him
		- He has an inkling something's been used on him as they're not caring if he knows or not 
		- Using similar powers to [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) such as sensing murderous intent but there's other things beyond that but [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) cannot tell what
		- It feels like somebody looking at him from under a microscope 
	- [Hawk](../Characters/NPCs/Hawk.md#) asks "If given the option to hunt down a member you have known to be part of our organization or another Kindred, which would you take?
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) starts to ask what type of other Kindred but stops and says it doesn't matter because the answer is obviously the other Kindred
		- [Hawk](../Characters/NPCs/Hawk.md#) proposes his question a different way using the trolley problem "To kill one of our members, you would save two human lives. To kill some other kindred you would only save one"
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) says that [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#)'s question and [Hawk](../Characters/NPCs/Hawk.md#)'s questions are contradictory (one asked about killing Kindred who intend to harm human lives and the other if he would harm a council member if they intended on harming human lives)
		- [Hawk](../Characters/NPCs/Hawk.md#) responds that he never said either would be harming humans but about saving them by killing
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) asks if he has to choose which [Hawk](../Characters/NPCs/Hawk.md#) tells him choice is all he has and aggressively tells him to make it
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) states blankly that he will hunt the other kindred
		- [Hawk](../Characters/NPCs/Hawk.md#) nods to [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) and the other council members and passes to the next council member

			- [Goose](Goose.md#) exclaims he heard your exploits and that it is good that he murdered many Kindred 
			- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responses that he prefers to think of it as community service
			- [Goose](Goose.md#) says that he thinks [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) will get his vote just for saying that but still has to ask questions
		- [Goose](Goose.md#) asks "Let's just say tasked for a job, you get to your choice of killing a kindred, an especially bad big murderer, but you know you most likely die in the process would you still going to go kill them?"
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) asks if any people are at risk but [Goose](Goose.md#) says that isn't his question but questions if [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) thinks there wouldn't be people at risk with a threat like that
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responses that he would "fucking try" which causes [Goose](Goose.md#) to chuckle
		- [Goose](Goose.md#) asks if he would try even going through fire, hell and brimstone 
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds they are already fire, hell and brimstone
		- [Goose](Goose.md#) comments that he is not a big fan of religious ones but still likes his comment and wishes [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) luck
- [Owl](../Characters/NPCs/Owl.md#)
		- Most disturbing to [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#)
		- Appearance
			- Childlike frame
			- Large owl
		- [Owl](../Characters/NPCs/Owl.md#) says that they have seen [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) in dreams and nightmares but can never see the end
		- [Owl](../Characters/NPCs/Owl.md#) asks "Why can't I see the end?"
			- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) asks if that is the question but she just stares and then her neck crooks down a bit too far than it should be able
			- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds that it is probably because he won't get to see the end myself the way he is going 
			- [Owl](../Characters/NPCs/Owl.md#)'s neck crooks back little the opposite way and says that the answer was cryptic but acceptable
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) asks if he is ready for their question which [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) answers disrespectfully which annoys [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) @34:29
		- "Have you ever truly seen death? Life leave eyes and leave nothing else?
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds yes

		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) retorts that he could have took it from a Kindred he killed but she can tell he is lying
			- They would have heard information from [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) as well as their own investigation
		- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) states that kindred do not differ too much from humans in that they have desires and needs and some of us will do terrible things to get that but some put their own needs below other and gone to help people
		- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) suggests that [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) wasn't a vegan in life and feigns disgust for killing living beings for his own good
		- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds that animals don't have souls only humans
		- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) ponders this and jokes from american media she was always sure all good dogs went to heaven
		- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) asks [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) if he remembers what Cain's punishment was
			- He would walk the earth. Wherever he stood things could not grow so he can no longer grow from the lands. Exiled from cities never allowed to have a home. Always to wander.
			- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) states that there's a reason kindred are called [Canite](Canite.md#)s and suggests that kindred already live a hell on Earth
			- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responses with a bible verse that they "are not fighting against Flesh and Blood enemies but against evil rulers and authorities of the Unseen World, against Mighty powers in this dark world and against evil spirits in the Heavenly places" - Ephesians 6:12
			- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) responds that he is a man of faith after all

			- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) questions if [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) is trying to convince him that Kindred are people too
			- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) says no and states they are monsters we are but that some monsters actually want to make the world a better place
			- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) retorts that everyone in the room can make the world a better place right now by walking hand in hand into the sunlight
			- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) asks "what if I think you're wrong" and [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds that they have a difference of opinion
			- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) replies that that is something wars are fought over and she has her vote
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) opens the floor to any other council members to ask a question and once they have decided their vote to put it in
- There is a yes/no switch on each podium
- [Trish](../Characters/NPCs/Trisha.md#)
	- "If you are used to hunt things down, what drove you to hunt things down before you came here? What drove you to kill Kindred?
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds he was indifferent until the hotel happened and that he doesn't give a shit about Kindred politics
	- [Trish](../Characters/NPCs/Trisha.md#) clarifies that she means that something made him do something for the hotel
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds that if he sees a group of Kindred trying to use people for sport that he is going to start trying to rip them apart
	- [Trish](../Characters/NPCs/Trisha.md#) questions that he only intervened because he saw it
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds that if she has the ability to show him Kindred wrongdoings he can't see, hear or find on his own then to give him names
	- [Trish](../Characters/NPCs/Trisha.md#) questions if that before he saw it he was just in blissful ignorance and says it seems odd that only tales of this magnitude are appearing now and, that for someone who truly hates Kindred so much, that they haven't done anything before now
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds that sometimes we're lost and need some sort of momentous event for us to find our path and our calling
	- [Trish](../Characters/NPCs/Trisha.md#) asks if [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) has noticed [Boston](../Places/Boston/index.md#) improving over the past 10-20 years

	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) questions if she is implying the [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) had a hand in that which [Trish](../Characters/NPCs/Trisha.md#) does a curtsy and sits back down
- [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#)

		- [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) doesn't know suspects most to feed on humans but given how many people you have hired as "feeders" given the [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) haven't had to replace any in a long while indicates no one is dying from it

	- [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) responds that she feels like they need to prove things to each other but also need to know that if we put our faith in you, you can also put your faith in us to even start that relationship
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) says he thinks he has answered her question
	- [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) asks "Do you think that we can have faith in each other long enough to prove to each other or will you stab us in the back immediately without giving us a chance?"

	- [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) asks "What if they become better through a change that saves their humanity?"
	- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#)'s eyes go wide with the realization of what [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) is asking him and stands in silence at the question before looking at [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) and answering with another bible verse "This is the condemnation that light is come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil" - John 3:19

- [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#), [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) and [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) notice that Owl only presses their button after everyone else has voted and places hers at the last second they placed their votes
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) asks if there is anything he would like to say before the verdict is announced
- [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) responds "If you wanted my loyalty, you wouldn't have brought me here in chains. You make it sound as if it's altruism, as if you could have just left me to be dust but then I wake up and you tell me I can either be your puppet or go back to being dust, that's all."
- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) sighs and announces the chains will stay, [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) lives

			- It looks like he is attempting to struggle against it but failing
		- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) goes behind him and gets down close and says something but his mind goes foggy at the words but [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) knows she commanded him to do something but he can't remember
		- [Osana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) puts a collar on his and holds a lead which she gives to [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) and returns to her podium

- [Asana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) explains that she finds those not willing to look "at more than just the cover of a book" to be insolent and that she has a great disdain for them
- [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) replies that that is the reason he asked the question in the Trial

	- [Asana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) tells [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) that she hopes he has the leash on him as [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) will be his weapon as long as he does
	- [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) questions if it actually controls him but [Asana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) cryptically replies that she has said what she has said and that since he will not take up ranged weapons that she gave him a weapon to use at range

		- [Asana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) advises to beat [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#)'s impurities out of him if he must but she trusts [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) to make the right decision as he has not failed her once and she would never let him fail her as she have chosen her rightful child

	- [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) is surprised
	- [Asana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) explains that although the [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) are a unanimous Council that they can have deals within themselves which is why councils change
	- [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) asks [Asana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) if she has seen a lot of change

- [Asana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) asks if [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) is hungry and [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) tells her he is content
- [Asana](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) tells [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) to have a productive night and that she will talk to him "when things have unveiled themselves" to her again but to enjoy the power at your fingertips for now

> They say a wolf is a solitary creature. It's not. It runs in packs runs, with those it trusts and you don't fight those it trusts because whether it be some corporate ass motherfucker or some lick who thinks they can get slick past me, I'll fuck any of them up. It's what wolves do. And like I said, don't make enemies of us, you'll come to regret it
