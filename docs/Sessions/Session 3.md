While [[Owl|Owl]] wants to take out key targets to stamp out his influence, [[Hawk|Hawk]] wants to let the [[Camarilla|Camarilla]] into the city to take the place of the [[Anarchs|Anarchs]]. [[Emmitt Delmar|Crow]] suggested that [[Kirkman|Kirkman]] may be biding his time and suggests to send out a survey party to understand his intentions. [[B|B]] experiences a vision. [[Swan|Swan]] decided to go with [[Emmitt Delmar|Crow]]'s plan.

[[Maggie|Maggie]] and [[Zeffér|Zeffér]] are sent to escort [[LA|LA]] star [[Amelia|Amelia]] to [[Kirkman|Kirkman]]'s 100th birthday party and for [[Maggie|Maggie]] to deliver some documents to on behalf of [[Emmitt Delmar|Crow]] as well as gather intel.

When [[Kirkman|Kirkman]] returns from calming down he announces the entertainment for the evening is a hunt of humans that have been brought to stay in the hotel rooms above. [[Maggie|Maggie]] passes information from [[Emmitt Delmar|Crow]] onto [[Kirkman|Kirkman]] as requested and is given a key to the private elevator.

She heads up the elevator before they open the main doors for the rest of the guests. When she reaches the fourth floor, she sees [[Saul |a kindred]] blocking the main door and closes the elevator doors. [[Saul | The unknown kindred]] rips the doors open to find a dagger at his neck. He states his intention to save the humans and warns [[Maggie|Maggie]] not to get in his way and offers a boon if she will help him. [[Maggie|Maggie]] calls HQ to get her next steps and helps [[Saul|the kindred]] by giving him one person and leaves him a business card. When the main doors open, she leaves the party.

[[Maggie|Maggie]] later meets [[Saul|Saul]] by the river, having tracked him via the tracker in the business card. She tells him that she will leave something at this spot when she needs him in the future.**Leader**:: [[Oisin|Oisin]]

- [[Anarchs|Anarchs]] keep the Masquerade up but fine with people being in the limelight and using technology
[[Session 4|Session 4]]
- [[Anarchs|Anarchs]] want freedom for Vampireshe group stall long enough for the [[Anarchs|Anarchs]] to show up and get [[Damien Hausberg|Damien]]. Unbeknownst to them, [[Zeffér|Zeffér]] also stalls to allow [[Regatta|Regatta]] agents to get in place to intercept.
