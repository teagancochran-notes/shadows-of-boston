# Summary
The [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) held a meeting at [HQ](../Places/Boston/Regatta%20HQ.md#council-room) to discuss [Kirkman](../Characters/NPCs/Kirkman.md#)'s increasing influence in [Boston](../Places/Boston/index.md#). While [Owl](../Characters/NPCs/Owl.md#) wants to take out key targets to stamp out his influence, [Hawk](../Characters/NPCs/Hawk.md#) wants to let the [Camarilla](../Organisations/Camarilla.md#) into the city to take the place of the [Anarchs](../Organisations/Anarchs.md#). [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#) suggested that [Kirkman](../Characters/NPCs/Kirkman.md#) may be biding his time and suggests to send out a survey party to understand his intentions. [B](B.md#) experiences a vision. [Swan](../Characters/NPCs/Swan.md#) decided to go with [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#)'s plan.
<br/>
[Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) and [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) are sent to escort [LA](../Places/LA/index.md#) star [Amelia](../Characters/PCs/Amelia.md#) to [Kirkman](../Characters/NPCs/Kirkman.md#)'s 100th birthday party and for [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) to deliver some documents to on behalf of [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#) as well as gather intel. At the party, [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) overhears some chatter about a shell company called [Ownark](Ownark.md#) and witnesses [Yasmin](../Characters/NPCs/Yasmin.md#) giving [Kirkman](../Characters/NPCs/Kirkman.md#) a ringed finger as a gift, which he is unhappy about.
<br/>
When [Kirkman](../Characters/NPCs/Kirkman.md#) returns from calming down he announces the entertainment for the evening is a hunt of humans that have been brought to stay in the hotel rooms above. [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) passes information from [Crow](../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt%20Delmar.md#) onto [Kirkman](../Characters/NPCs/Kirkman.md#) as requested and is given a key to the private elevator.
<br/>
She heads up the elevator before they open the main doors for the rest of the guests. When she reaches the fourth floor, she sees [a kindred](Saul.md#) blocking the main door and closes the elevator doors. [ The unknown kindred](Saul.md#) rips the doors open to find a dagger at his neck. He states his intention to save the humans and warns [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) not to get in his way and offers a boon if she will help him. [Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) calls HQ to get her next steps and helps [the kindred](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) by giving him one person and leaves him a business card. When the main doors open, she leaves the party.
<br/>
[Maggie](../Characters/PCs/Maggie.md#) later meets [a kindred](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) by the river, having tracked him via the tracker in the business card. She tells him that she will leave something at this spot when she needs him in the future. ^summary
