# Summary
[Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) and [Sasha](../Characters/PCs/Sasha.md#) are given the task by their respective organisations to capture [Damien Hausberg](../Characters/NPCs/Damien%20Hausberg.md#) - an escapee from [The Incident](../Events/The%20Incident.md#). Meanwhile, [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) is tasked to kill the hunter that his after the escapees. [Sasha](../Characters/PCs/Sasha.md#) hires Magi, [Kiki](../Characters/NPCs/Kiki.md#) to locate [Damien](../Characters/NPCs/Damien%20Hausberg.md#). They, [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) and [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) all find themselves at an office complex where [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) and [Sasha](../Characters/PCs/Sasha.md#) team up and fight [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) and the Feds. The fight eventually leads them to [Kiki's Shop](../Places/Boston/Miss%20Kiki's%20Healing%20Center.md#) were they encounter the hunter [Saul](../Characters/PCs/Saul.md#) is after, where [Kiki](../Characters/NPCs/Kiki.md#) is shot and [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) is [entranced](Entrancement.md#). The group stall long enough for the [Anarchs](../Organisations/Anarchs.md#) to show up and get [Damien](../Characters/NPCs/Damien%20Hausberg.md#). Unbeknownst to them, [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) also stalls to allow [Regatta](../Organisations/Regatta.md#) agents to get in place to intercept. Although ultimately successful in his mission, [Zeffér](../Characters/PCs/Zeff%C3%A9r.md#) loses control of the beast which has fatal consequences for his driver. Accidents happen, or so they say. ^summary
