Damien is a member of the [[../../Organisations/Regatta|Regatta]] council and is the Childer of [[Goose|Goose]]. Damien joined the council only a few years ago as wears a duck mask.

[[../PCs/Maggie|Maggie]] and [[../PCs/Zeffér|Zeffér]] teasingly call him "Duckie" but he also goes by the nickname "Dan".

Damien appears to be in his early twenties.

Damien has shown a disinterest in the bureaucracy of the council, often wanting to avoid paperwork and appearing to not pay attention in council meetings.
